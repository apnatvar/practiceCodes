Hi, these are more than just practice codes. You can probably reuse all of these directly or in some form for your projects. 
Below is a description of each file. To look for the file you want press Command+F on a Mac-Safari and ctrl+f on Windows-Chrome
Files 
1. AlphaToASCII - A very simple code. Takes a string as input and outputs the ASCII Values of each character
Ignored all spaces. 
2. BasicHashFunction - Inputs a string and hashes it. It uses weighted hashing so that anagrams can have different hash values. 
This allow various Strings to have the same hash value. 
3. LargeAndSmallPrime - A small menu driven program. 
Users can input 0 - to get a list of primes in the entered range.
Input 1 - to get a large prime(possibly) using Miller Rabin algorithm. This can used for cryptographic purposes.
4. LinearProbeHashing - Same as BasicHashFunction. Returns unique values only, with the help of linear probing.
5. QuadraticProbeHashing - Same as BasicHashFunction. Returns unique values only, with the help of quadratic probing.
6. removeDuplicateFromStrings - removes repetitive occurances of a character from the input string. Case sensitive.
7. checkBST - checks if the passed tree is Balanced Binary Tree or not.
8. treeBFS - Moves through the tree level wise, Performs best first search on the tree.
9. SearchInRotatedArray - a rotated array is aa sorted array that was 'rotated' 
Ex: [1,2,3,4,5] is a sorted array and [3,4,5,1,2] is the rotated sorted array. Searches in such using Binary Search / without any sorting.

I will be adding more code as I keep going forward.
