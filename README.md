Hi, these are more than just practice codes. You can probably reuse all of these directly or in some form for your projects. 
Below is a description of each file. To look for the file you want press Command+F on a Mac-Safari and ctrl+f on Windows-Chrome
Files 
1. AlphaToASCII - A very simple code. Takes a string as input and outputs the ASCII Values of each character
Ignored all spaces. 
2. BasicHashFunction - Inputs a string and hashes it. It uses weighted hashing so that anagrams can have different hash values. 
This allow various Strings to have the same hash value. 
3. LargeAndSmallPrime - A small menu driven program. 
Users can input 0 - to get a list of primes in the entered range.
Input 1 - to get a large prime(possibly) using Miller Rabin algorithm. This can used for cryptographic purposes.
4. LinearProbeHashing - Same as BasicHashFunction. Returns unique values only, with the help of linear probing.
5. QuadraticProbeHashing - Same as BasicHashFunction. Returns unique values only, with the help of quadratic probing.
6. removeDuplicateFromStrings - removes repetitive occurances of a character from the input string. Case sensitive.
7. checkBST - checks if the passed tree is Balanced Binary Tree or not.
8. treeBFS - Moves through the tree level wise, Performs best first search on the tree.
9. SearchInRotatedArray - a rotated array is aa sorted array that was 'rotated' 
Ex: [1,2,3,4,5] is a sorted array and [3,4,5,1,2] is the rotated sorted array. Searches in such using Binary Search / without any sorting.
10. ConnectNodesAtSameLevel - connects all nodes at the same level in a bast as a linked list by modifying the original structure.
11. FindMissingAndReapeat - in a non-sorted array of 1-n+1 there is 1 number missing and 1 number entered twice. Finds and prints the missing and double number.
12. DeleteWithoutHeadPointer - function is passed the address of the element ot be deleted but the head node is not available. Deletes this head node.
13. PrintLast10 - prints last the last 10 lines in a large string. If less than 10 strings are available, will print all of those.
14. BinaryAdditionAndSubtracation - performs addition and subration using binary. Without using arithmetic operators.
15. MaxXORSubaray - Finds the max Xor n the subarray using Kadane's Algorithm
16. FibNumOptimised - Recursive approaach with memoization to find the nth number in a fibonacci series
17. BuildWordandHow - Construct a given word from a list of substring and output every possible combination that constructs the original word
18. BuildWordfromGivenSubstring - check if a given word can be constructed from a list of substrings or not
19. TargetSumwithMinNumberstoAdd - output the smallest set up of numbers from a list that add up to a given number
20. CountWaystoBuildWord - count the number of ways given substrings can be arranged ot make the given word
21. TargetSumwithNumbersToAdd - reach the target number by adding numbers and display any one of the solutions
22. TargetSumfromGivenNumbers - output if you can/cannot read the target with the given lsit o fnumbers
23. GridTravellingOptimised - used a recursive approach and memoization to calculate the number of ways you can reach the bottom right box in the grid from the top left.
24. qrcode - python code to generate a QRCode for a given link. 
25. goldenGoal - 2 players try to score a goal to win the game on a 3x5 grid. Outputs grid after every turn on cmd. Players can chose to kick the ball (to a random location) or move with the ball, tackle and move, save goals.
26. Weather-application - This was code written to develop a Weather Application using Javascript for Internet Application module at Trinity College Dublin. It runs on an express server and emulates a client-server model and receives information from a third party using REST APIs, parses it into its own API and communicates with the client.
26. website - folder contains code I am developing for my portfolio website. This will be hosted on AWS S3 when I finish with the codes.
27. fcc_sciComp - codes I wrote for my freeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python Certificaion, accessed at https://freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc901fd6a0-d5f9-498d-b8e0-a27d204a8976/scientific-computing-with-python-v7

I will be adding more code as I keep going forward.
